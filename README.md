<h1>Data Structures and Algorithms</h1>

<p>
In computer science, a data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, it is a collection of data values, relationships among them, and the operations that can be applied to the data. The operations should be applied in an efficient way.
</p>

The following are characteristics of data strucuters:
<ul>
<li>Domain - set data values</li>
<li>Structure - relationship among values which can either be linear or non-linear</li>
<li>Operations - functions that can be done to access or modify the data</li>
<li>Efficiency</li>
<ul>
<li>Efficient structure - requires minimal storage or memory</li>
<li>Efficient operations - requires optimal time to process</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>
In computer science we have internal and external dada structures. Internal data structures deal with how data is stored and processed in primary memory, RAM. In contrast to this, external data structure are concerned with how data is stored and retrieved in secondary memory like Solid State Drives.
