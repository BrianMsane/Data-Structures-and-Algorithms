<h1>Queue Data Structue</h1>
<p>
A queue is an ordered homogeneous list in which insertions are dones at one end called the rear, deletions are done at other end called <strong>front</strong>. I assumes the FIFO structure in the sense that the first element to be added to the queue is the first element to be removed. Adding elements to a stack is and operation called enqueue, and deleting elements is an operation called dequeue. A perfect analogy used is one of a bank; customers in a bank stand on a queue and the first customer to arrive, is the first customer to be serviced and leave.
